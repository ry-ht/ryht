## Conclusion

**Cortex is a well-architected, production-ready cognitive memory system** that successfully implements sophisticated memory hierarchies with strong engineering practices. The main gaps are around context window management, forgetting policies, and just-in-time loading—areas that are critical for effective LLM integration.

With the recommended Priority 1 improvements, Cortex would achieve **9.5/10 rating** and become best-in-class for cognitive memory systems.

**Final Verdict**: Ready for production use with planned improvements for optimization and AI integration.
