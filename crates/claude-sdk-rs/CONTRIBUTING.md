## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Valid Anthropic API key (for integration tests)

### Building

```bash
cargo build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p claude-sdk-rs-core

# Check test coverage
make test-coverage
```

#### Writing Tests

When contributing new features or fixes, please include appropriate tests:

**Unit Test Example:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_config_builder_with_timeout() {
    let config = Config::builder()
        .timeout_secs(120)
        .build();
    
    assert_eq!(config.timeout_secs, Some(120));
}
```

**Async Test Example:**
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_client_query() {
    let client = Client::new(Config::default());
    
    // Skip if Claude CLI not available
    if which::which("claude").is_err() {
        return;
    }
    
    let result = client.query("test").send().await;
    assert!(result.is_ok() || matches!(result, Err(Error::ClaudeNotAuthenticated)));
}
```

**Property Test Example:**
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_session_id_roundtrip(s in "[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,50}") {
        let id = SessionId::new(&s);
        assert_eq!(id.as_str(), s);
    }
}
```

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guidelines.

### Code Style & Formatting

#### Formatting Requirements

**All code must be properly formatted before committing.** We use `rustfmt` with default settings to ensure consistent code style across the project.

**Before committing, always run:**
```bash
# Format all code
cargo fmt --all

# Verify formatting is correct
cargo fmt --check
```

**Pre-commit Hook:**
The repository includes a pre-commit hook that automatically checks formatting. If your code isn't properly formatted, the commit will be rejected with helpful instructions.

#### Style Guidelines

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines (enforced by `rustfmt`)
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing (required)
- Ensure `cargo clippy` passes without warnings
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Include tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions reasonably sized and focused

#### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code (required)
cargo fmt --all

# Check for common issues and style violations
cargo clippy --all-features

# Check for security vulnerabilities
cargo audit

# Run all checks together
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --all-features && cargo test
```

## Project Structure

- `claude-sdk-rs-core/`: Core types and traits
- `claude-sdk-rs-runtime/`: Process management and runtime
- `claude-sdk-rs-mcp/`: MCP protocol implementation
- `claude-sdk-rs-macros/`: Procedural macros
- `claude-sdk-rs/`: Main SDK crate
- `examples/`: Usage examples

## Pull Request Process

1. **Format your code**: Run `cargo fmt --all` and ensure `cargo fmt --check` passes
2. **Ensure all tests pass**: Run `cargo test --workspace`
3. **Check for linting issues**: Run `cargo clippy --all-features`
4. **Verify security**: Run `cargo audit` to check for vulnerabilities
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md (if applicable)
7. Ensure your commits are well-described
8. Link any related issues

**Note:** Pull requests with formatting violations will be automatically rejected. Please run the pre-commit checks locally before submitting.

## Areas for Contribution

## Publishing Process

### Publishing to crates.io

The project uses a automated publish script that handles the complex dependency chain between crates. The crates must be published in a specific order due to their interdependencies:

1. `claude-sdk-rs-core` (no internal dependencies)
2. `claude-sdk-rs-mcp` (depends on core)
3. `claude-sdk-rs-runtime` (depends on core and mcp)
4. `claude-sdk-rs` (depends on core, runtime, and optionally mcp)
5. `claude-sdk-rs-interactive` (depends on claude-sdk-rs and core)

#### Using the Publish Script

```bash
# Dry run (recommended first step)
DRY_RUN=true ./scripts/publish.sh

# Actual publish
./scripts/publish.sh

# With custom options
SLEEP_TIME=60 ./scripts/publish.sh  # Wait 60s between publishes
FORCE_CONTINUE=true ./scripts/publish.sh  # Continue on errors
VERIFY_DEPENDENCIES=false DRY_RUN=true ./scripts/publish.sh  # Skip dependency checks in dry run
```

#### Environment Variables

- `DRY_RUN`: Set to `true` to perform a dry run without actually publishing (default: false)
- `SLEEP_TIME`: Seconds to wait between publishing crates for crates.io processing (default: 30)
- `FORCE_CONTINUE`: Set to `true` to continue publishing even if a crate fails (default: false)
- `VERIFY_DEPENDENCIES`: Set to `false` to skip dependency verification in dry runs (default: true)
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: Your crates.io API token (required for actual publishing)

#### Manual Publishing

If you need to publish crates manually, ensure you follow the dependency order:

```bash
# 1. First publish core (no dependencies)
cd claude-sdk-rs-core && cargo publish && cd ..

# 2. Wait for crates.io to process (important!)
sleep 30

# 3. Then publish crates that depend only on core
cd claude-sdk-rs-mcp && cargo publish && cd ..
sleep 30

# 4. Then runtime (depends on core and mcp)
cd claude-sdk-rs-runtime && cargo publish && cd ..
sleep 30

# 5. Then main SDK
cd claude-sdk-rs && cargo publish && cd ..
sleep 30

# 6. Finally the CLI
cd claude-sdk-rs-interactive && cargo publish && cd ..
```

#### Pre-publish Checklist

Before publishing a new version:

1. **Update version numbers** in all Cargo.toml files
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the new version and changes
3. **Run all tests**: `cargo test --workspace`
4. **Check formatting**: `cargo fmt --check`
5. **Run clippy**: `cargo clippy --all-features`
6. **Security audit**: `cargo audit`
7. **Dry run publish**: `DRY_RUN=true ./scripts/publish.sh`
8. **Tag the release**: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`

#### Troubleshooting

**"no matching package named" errors during dry run:**
This is expected if the dependencies aren't published yet. Use `VERIFY_DEPENDENCIES=false` for dry runs.

**"crate version is already uploaded" error:**
The version number already exists on crates.io. Bump the version in Cargo.toml.

**Network/API errors:**
The script will retry automatically. If it continues to fail, check your internet connection and crates.io status.

**"Failed to change to directory" error:**
Ensure you're running the script from the workspace root directory.
