## 🌟 Naming Concept

**ry.ht** = rhythm + thought

The dual-system architecture mirrors biological neural systems:

- **Axon** = Signal transmission pathways (agent coordination)
- **Cortex** = Cognitive processing center (memory & thought)

Together they form a complete neural architecture for intelligent agent systems.

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose Tauri over Electron for Axon (better performance, smaller bundle)
- SQLite + Tantivy for Cortex (embedded, no external dependencies)
- Workspace structure allows code sharing while maintaining modularity
- AGPL-3.0 for Axon (based on original opcode), MIT/Apache-2.0 for Cortex

### Experimental Projects
The `experiments/` folder contains various prototypes and POCs:
- `opcode/` - Original opcode project (now renamed to axon)
- Other agent-related experiments
- All excluded from main repository via `.gitignore`
