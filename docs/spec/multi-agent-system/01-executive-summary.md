# Axon: Executive Summary

## Vision

Axon represents the next evolution in multi-agent orchestration systems - a synthesis of the best patterns, optimizations, and architectural innovations from six leading multi-agent platforms, built on a solid Rust foundation with native desktop integration.

Our vision is to create a system where AI agents work together as seamlessly as neurons in a brain, with Axon serving as the neural pathways that coordinate their activities and Cortex providing the shared cognitive memory.

### How Axon Uses Cortex

#### 1. Session Management
When Axon assigns a task to an agent, it creates an isolated session in Cortex:
- **POST /sessions** - Create isolated workspace for agent
- **GET /sessions/{id}/files/{path}** - Agent reads files from its session
- **PUT /sessions/{id}/files/{path}** - Agent writes changes to session
- **POST /sessions/{id}/merge** - Merge agent's changes back to main

#### 2. Context Retrieval
Before executing tasks, agents query Cortex for relevant context:
- **POST /memory/search** - Find similar past episodes
- **GET /memory/patterns** - Retrieve learned patterns
- **POST /search/semantic** - Semantic code search
- **GET /workspaces/{id}/units** - Get code units and dependencies

#### 3. Knowledge Persistence
After task completion, Axon stores results in Cortex:
- **POST /memory/episodes** - Save development episode
- **POST /tasks** - Update task status and metrics
- **PUT /files/{id}** - Persist code changes

#### 4. Real-time Coordination
Axon subscribes to Cortex events for coordination:
- **WebSocket /ws** - Real-time updates on sessions, locks, conflicts
- Lock notifications for conflict avoidance
- Session merge status updates

### Division of Responsibility

| Responsibility | Owner | Implementation |
|---------------|-------|----------------|
| Task Orchestration | Axon | Workflow Engine, DAG execution |

| Consensus Mechanisms | Axon | Sangha voting, decision making |
| UI & Visualization | Axon | Tauri desktop app, dashboard |
| Data Storage | Cortex | SurrealDB, VFS, Code units |
| Session Isolation | Cortex | Copy-on-write namespaces |
